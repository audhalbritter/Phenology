## Question{.columns-2}


```{r, out.width=400, fig.retina = 1}

```

Do alpine plant communities transplanted along a temperature and precipitation gradient differ in their phenological responses from the origin/destination communities, and to what extent are these differences plastic or genetically determined?

## Hypotheses - Plasticity{.columns-2}


```{r, out.width=500, fig.retina = 1}
knitr::include_graphics("Pics_Presentation/TransplantDesign_Plast.jpg")
```

- Communities transplanted to warmer conditions flower earlier than origin community (Brunet et al. Botany 2012, Scheepens and Stöckli Oecologia 2013)
- Communities transplanted to wetter conditions flower later than origin community (but see Brunet et al. Botany 2012)
- Communities transplanted to warmer and wetter conditions…

## Hypotheses - Adaptation{.columns-2}

```{r, out.width=500, fig.retina = 1}
knitr::include_graphics("Pics_Presentation/TransplantDesign_Adapt.jpg")
```

- Communities transplanted to warmer conditions (earlier snowmelt) are likely to flower earlier than the destination community (Anderson et al. Proc. R. Soc. B. 2012)
- Communities transplanted to wetter conditions (later snowmelt) are likely to flower later than the destination community
- Communities transplanted to warmer and wetter conditions…
