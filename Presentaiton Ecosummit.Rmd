## Adaptation and Plasticity

- Aaptation
- Plasticity


## Question
Do alpine plant communities transplanted along a temperature and precipitation gradient differ in their phenological responses from the origin/destination communities, and to what extent are these differences plastic or genetically determined?

## Hypotheses


## Method - SeedClim

```{r}


```

## Alpine plant communities are plastic

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
