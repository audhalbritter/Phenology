## Plasticity and Adaptation

- Aaptation
- Plasticity

## Study area
```{r, out.width=500}
knitr::include_graphics("Fjord.jpg")
```

## Transplant design

## Recording phenology

## Question
Do alpine plant communities transplanted along a temperature and precipitation gradient differ in their phenological responses from the origin/destination communities, and to what extent are these differences plastic or genetically determined?
```{r, out.width=500}
knitr::include_graphics("Pics_Presentation/TransplantDesign.jpg")
```

## Hypotheses - Plasticity

- Communities transplanted to warmer conditions flower earlier than origin community (Brunet et al. Botany 2012, Scheepens and Stöckli Oecologia 2013)
- Communities transplanted to wetter conditions flower later than origin community (but see Brunet et al. Botany 2012)
- Communities transplanted to warmer and wetter conditions…
```{r, out.width=500}
knitr::include_graphics("Pics_Presentation/TransplantDesign_Plast.jpg")
```


## Hypotheses - Adaptation

- Communities transplanted to warmer conditions (earlier snowmelt) are likely to flower earlier than the destination community (Anderson et al. Proc. R. Soc. B. 2012)
- Communities transplanted to wetter conditions (later snowmelt) are likely to flower later than the destination community
- Communities transplanted to warmer and wetter conditions…
